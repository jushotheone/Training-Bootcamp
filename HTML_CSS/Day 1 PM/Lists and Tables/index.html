<!-- Nesting Elements:

<!-- Nesting can be seen in elements such as lists and tables -->

    <!-- 
    HTML Lists: 

    - Lists within HTML allow us to group items together
      in a few different ways.
 -->

    <!-- 
    <ul> Unordered List: 

    - An unordered list is opened with a <ul> tag and
      each list item is defined within an <li> tag.

    - List items in an unordered list are bullet pointed
      with a black circle by default.

    - An example of where an unordered list would be
      used would be a menu for a cafe.
 -->
    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Tea</li>
        <li>Coffee</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 
    <ol> Ordered List: 

    - An ordered list is opened with a <ol> tag
     and similarly to the unordered list each list item
     is defined within an <li> tag.
    - List items in an ordered list are numbered by default.
    - An example of where an ordered list would be used would be listing ordered instructions.
 -->

    <ol>
        <li>First</li>
        <li>Second</li>
        <li>Third</li>
    </ol>


    <!-- 
    HTML Tables: 

    - Tables allow us to organise data into rows and columns.
    - A table is opened with a <table> tag.
 -->
    <!-- 
    <tr> Table Row: 

    - A <tr> element represents a row of cells in a table.
 -->
    <!-- 
    <th> Table Header: 

    - A <th> element represents a header cell in a table.
 -->

    <!-- 
    <td> Table Data: 

    - A <td> element represents a data cell in a table.
 -->
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Email</th>
            <th>Number</th>

        <tr>
            <td>John</td>
            <td>John@mail.com</td>
