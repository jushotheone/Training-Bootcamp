Day 3 HTML CSS AM - Task:

Using the CSS Position property I would like you to put together an example of a fixed navbar that remains at the top of the viewport when scrolling through a page.

Group Task - Advanced CSS Selectors:

Each breakout room will be assigned a topic, I would like you to research your topic and put together a short demonstration / presentation on it to present to the group later in the session.
How you demo / explain your topic is up to you to decide as a group. Feel free to share your screen and do a code-along demo or explain it using a presentation of some sort. Please ensure that you organise amongst yourselves who will share their screen and who will present what.
We will be coming back into the main meeting room at 11:45am in order to run through the presentations.
