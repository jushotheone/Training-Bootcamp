            <h1>What are EM and REM?</h1>
            <h2>EM and REM are scalable CSS Units.</h2>
            <p>When working with responsive design using EM and REM allows us to scale our
                elements up and down, rather
                than
                working with fixed units such as pixels.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="em">
            <h2>EM</h2>
            <h3>EM is unit of measure relative to the font size of the nearest parent element. In this example this
                would
                be
                our div with the class of "em".</h3>
            <p>If our "em" div has a "font-size" value set to 20px then 1em = 20px and 10em = 200px etc.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rem">
            <h2>REM</h2>
            <h3>REM is unit of measure relative to the font size of the root / html element, which if not specificaly
                set will
                default to
                16px.</h3>
            <p>If the font-size of our root / html element isn't overwritten 1rem = 16px and 10rem = 160px </p>
